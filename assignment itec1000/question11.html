				<td>Particular strengths and weakness</td>
				<td>Strengths:GIF is suitable for sharp-edged line such as logos and simple drawing.Weaknesss:GIF format is limited to 256 colors which is insufficient to display the details of photograph.</td>
				<td>Strength:PNG was designed for transferring images on the Internet.Weakness:It was not designed for  professional-quality print graphics and therefore does not support non-RGB color spaces such as CMYK.</td>
				<td>Strengths:The JPEG compression algorithm is at its best on photographs and paintings of realistic scenes with smooth variations of tone and color.Weakness:JPEG may not be as well suited for line drawings and other textual or iconic graphics, where the sharp contrasts between adjacent pixels can cause noticeable artifacts.JPEG is also not well suited to files that will undergo multiple edits, as some image quality will usually be lost each time the image is decompressed and recompressed, particularly if the image is cropped or shifted, or if encoding parameters are changed.</td>
