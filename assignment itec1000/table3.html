	<p>3. Convert the binary number 111100011100111110 to the base system number indicated using the grouping method discussed in class. 
	Explain your strategies for each conversion. [12 marks]

	<p><span style="font-weight:900">Qaternary:</span>The largest number that can be represented by each bit in quaternary system number is 3.Also the number 3 can be represented by two digits in binary systemnumber(11).so we have to divide the binary number(111100011100111110) into groups of number with two digits and convert each two digits in binary to a number in quternary.</p>
	
	<p><span style="font-weight:900">Octal:</span>The largest number that can be represented by each bit in octal system number is 7.Also the number 7 can be represented by three digits in binary systemnumber(111).so we have to divide the binary number (111100011100111110)into groups of number with three digits and convert each three digits in binary to a number in octal.</p>

	<p><span style="font-weight:900">Hexadecimal:</span>The largest number that can be represented by each bit in hexadecimal system number is 15(F).Also the number 15 can be represented by four digits in binary systemnumber(1111).so we have to divide the binary number (111100011100111110)into groups of number with four digits and convert each four digits in binary to a number in hexadecimal.</p>
